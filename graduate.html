                        <p>My aim is to spend my career working in a local government setting. I want a chance to "give back" by contributing to the provision of services that I have taken for granted for a large portion of my life. I believe there are many roles within local government where I could leverage my skills to make meaningful contributions.</p>
                        <p>If you're anything like I once was, you may never have thought about all the behind-the-scenes work that goes into the conveniences present in your own home. See the videos below to get a glimpse into how clean water is supplied to your home and how your home's solid waste is handled:</p>

                        <h2>My Plans and Goals in Local Government</h2> <br>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span class="bold">Projected career path</span>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Work for a year as a city management intern.</li>
                                    <li>Get a full-time role as a city management analyst. Management analysts serve as liaisons between individual city departments and city administration. They perform ad hoc and routine analyses on budgeting, accounting, human resources, and other operating data for various city departments. Through these analyses and accompanying recommendations, management analysts seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of city operations.</li>
                                    <li>Through my work as a management analyst, I hope to gain familiarity and even a degree of expertise in all city departments and how they function together to provide municipal services to residents. With this broad base of knowledge, I would like to ultimately work as an analyst for a city. In this role, I would interface with the city IT department to design software systems and data workflows that integrate and streamline the functions of city government.</li>
                                    <li>Perhaps working as a management analyst would instead lead me to desire going into more of a managerial role. If this happens, I may seek to become an assistant city manager instead of an analyst. However, I feel like I would prefer a management role in a smaller town instead of a big city.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li> <br>
                            <li>
                                <span class="bold">Experiences in local level public administration to-date</span>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>I have spent the past 6 months working for the Marriott School as a student consultant/aid to the assistant dean over philanthropy and fundraising. While this is not technically a local government role, the experience I have had with developing donor acknowledgement content will be a great asset to me in future intern and management analyst roles, as holders of these positions in a city often do a great deal of grant writing.</li>
                                    <li>As an MPA student, I participated in a local government case competition in March 2024. In a team of 3 other students, we developed a professional presentation regarding how to respond to evidence of financial mismanagement in a city government. We presented our findings and recommendations to a panel of judges consisting of three current city managers in the state of Utah. The insights, feedback, and challenge associated with this experience will be invaluable as I officially begin a career in a city.</li>
                                    <li>Again as an MPA student, I worked on a team of 4 fellow students to complete an extensive research-based report on the problem of homelessness in Utah communities. The knowledge gained from this experience about resources and best practices for helping individuals experiencing homelessness was instructive and eye-opening. Equally valuable were the skills of teamwork and professional communication and presentation that I practiced. This experience will give me a step up in addressing homelessness in any city I work for in the future.</li>
                                    <li>I begin a management internship with the City of Orem at the end of April 2024. In this role, I will gain broad exposure to local government administration by conducting research, analyzing and assembling data, writing grants, building reports for personnel in various city departments, helping with the delivery of city programs and services, and much more.</li>
                                    <li>Finally, as I transition into my target role as a city analyst, I will draw upon the extensive experience I had in my first post-college job with querying large databases, building accessible reports, and communicating the results of my analysis in a simple, action-oriented manner.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li> <br>
                            <li>
                                <span class="bold">Anticipated contributions to local government</span>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>I understand that reports and other user-facing products of data analysts' work are only effective if the end-user(s) is involved from the beginning of the process all the way through to the end. I would be able to act on this understanding to build municipal technology solutions that work and that last.</li>
                                    <li>In school settings (especially the MPA program) and in personal settings, I have developed a reputation as a leader who values the input and ideas of others. I would thus be able to work harmoniously with diverse teams, leveraging the ideas of those different from me to provide services - tangible and virtual - more efficiently and equitably than I could alone.</li>
                                    <li>I am unyieldingly precise in my communication. City managers need colleagues and analysts who are unambiguous, objective, and transparent as they deliver information, especially when that information has direct bearing on the lives of city residents. My honesty and thoroughness will help me gain trust of coworkers so that the administrative affairs of the city are ultimately run more effectively.</li>
                                    <li>I am persistent, responsible, and hardworking - and to a much greater degree than the "garden variety" individual who claims these traits. I am willing to work into the night to complete an important task that someone is depending on me to complete. I have done this time and time again on MPA group projects and in my previous work experience. Public entities - cities in particular - need employees of this caliber, employees who will sacrifice personal convenience to ensure that services the public depends on are delivered and are delivered well. I am fully committed to putting the public interest over my own.</li>
